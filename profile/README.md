## Hi there 👋
### I hope you are doing well :) This semester, we are together in the advanced programming course using the Java programming language, and we will gain new experiences together. Please note that your first four assignments will be published on [Quera](www.quera.org), and you should upload your answers there.

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
